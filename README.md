Hey, ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jhon Vargas, a keen practitioner of Data Science and technical leader.

Normally life is very risky as any project itself, so we need to take the risk of decisions all day, every minute, every second. As much information we get about it, I think we can conduct a better decision and route our goals in the best way.


# #Experience

I worked almost 10 years on Telecom as a tecnical leader. Since 2019, I started a side(personal) project in MERN stack where I realized that I liked to do these things about software that's why I switched to Computer Science field since 2020 and there is where I met data science world doing stuff like optimization, machine learning models, deep learning models in NLP, CV and so on.

In 2022 after get a lot of knowledge on data science, project and business, I launched commercial a startup [iTresse](https://itresse.com/) focus on analytics getting some retail customers like florists, travel agency, clothes retail, etc creating supervised models for churn, CLTV, forecasting, etc. 

And these things come up with handle soft skills like good customer relationship with effective communication, self confidence and experience in project and technical management frameworks like Scrum/PMP. 

# #Knowledge

Currently I am on finishing(thesis phase) my Master of Computer Science at [UNI](https://uni.edu.pe) and also I belong to the 4th Generation of [BREIT/APORTA](https://www.datascienceglobalskills.pe/) Advanced Program in Data Science & Global Skills with the partnership of [MIT IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu/).

During those years I've started with **Javascript** and **MySQL** languages. In the master of CC, I've learned **python**, **C++** for research projects mainly. In my short phase on iTresse, I'd learned visual data story telling with **Tableau** and big data infrastructure in **Google** for creating data pipelines. 

# #Personal

Iâ€™m interested to deploy applied predictive analytics, contribute on machine learning projects related Natural Language Processing and use statistics to solve real business problems. You can contact me in my personal email: jhon.vargasr@gmail.com for any queries or by {{< link name = "linkedin" path = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yonkeenn/">}}

>> My vision is to try to humanize the mathematical models of machine learning in order to improve the life style of the society.
